This is my first project, created for the final exam (Coders Lab bootcamp).
It is a simple expense tracker meant for mobile devices, thus please keep the screen width at around 300-600 px.

## Technologies used:
* React,
* React Router v6,
* SCSS

## Details:
I have added several hardcoded transactions, but they can be easily deleted or modified.

## Shout outs to:
